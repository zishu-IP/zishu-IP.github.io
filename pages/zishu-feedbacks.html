                          <b>6 month checkpoint review</b>
                          <p>Zishu has become a key part of the Digital@BP account which is one of the largest accounts in IBM iX, with an active value of approximately $50 million. It is also one of the most reused case studies/references across GBS globally. It's a flagship account that Zishu is now <span class="highlight-green">a key contributor</span> to. 

                          <p>Zishu has been described as being <span class="highlight-green">a critical part of the Castrol Fast Lane team </span> which is one of our core projects on the Digital@BP account. Zishu was <span class="highlight-green">imperative to readying this application for the Go-Live and meeting client set deadlines </span> so we could invoice accordingly and also build new opportunities with the client. This is evident in the work he is doing with Google Analytics and the potential pipeline this is creating for IBM. 
                              
                          <p>In terms of client activity, the <span class="highlight-green">client are delighted with the investment and support they are getting from someone of Zishu’s ability.</span> Zishu has worked and impressed a global client in BP, <span class="highlight-green">the client has remarked on multiple occasions their pleasure of having Zishus help with a core project in their ecosystem.</span> 
                          
                          <p>Zishu is <span class="highlight-green">a very kind, friendly and likeable member </span> of the Digital@BP team, his feedback showcases his popularity with the client and IBM team alike. He has <span class="highlight-green">gone above and beyond to learn skills and take on tasks</span> that provide respite and help to a very overstretched and busy team. They have been delighted with the help and support he has provided and impressed with his ability to be foreward thinking and <span class="highlight-green">pro actively take on additional tasks.</span>

                          <p>Zishu is involved with various pieces of giveback and has got involved with various communities within IBM. He is certainly <span class="highlight-green">making the most of his placement.</span> 
                              
                          <p>Zishu has <span class="highlight-green">quickly transitioned from someone who wants to learn development into a trusted developer in his own right. </span>
                              
                          <p>Zishu has <span class="highlight-green">worked tirelessly to build up a skillset</span> so he can not just perform in his role but exceed expectations and get involved with additional work. This is due to Zishus innate ambition and work ethic. 
                              
                          <p>In a short space of time Zishu has learned how an Agile project operates, Dev-Ops, a variety of complex coding languages including react, Web Development, Back-End Development and Google Analytics. 
                              
                          <p><span class="highlight-green">This is beyond impressive. Zishu is a self starter and self learner and has been able to showcase these skills and innovative ways of applying them regularly to his clients. </span>

                          <p><b>ACE Reivew</b></p>
                          <p>Zishu is <span class="highlight-green">full of energy and enthusiasm</span>. He clearly wants to learn as much as he can and get involved with as many things as he can during his tenure with IBM. He's currently working as a developer on the the Digital@BP Hub, a microsite that we've built to showcase our partnership with BP and Castrol Fast Lane a Castrol client facing website that supplies products to Castrols distributors. Zishu, who is also learning Salesforce, will no doubt do very well within the technical sphere, I've been impressed with <span class="highlight-green">the breadth of knowledge and platforms that Zishu has touched in his short time with IBM</span>. He's very <span class="highlight-green">kind, friendly and polite </span>and has also got involved with the LGBT community. Improvement points includes<span class="highlight"> ensuring he takes his time to learn and listen to those in leadership positions</span>, sometimes through his enthusiasm it can come across that he's not making the time to learn and really delve into the tasks being assigned to him.

                      <p> - good eye contact and engagement with audience throughout - very confident and enthusiastic

                      <p> - think about a clear structure to your slides with a consistent layout to help your audience keep on track - some of the slides were very busy ;-)

                      <b>6 Month checkpoint Feedback</b>

                      <p>Zishu has now completed 6 months of his placement as an Interactive Developer.  During this time he has received consistently excellent feedback from his task manager and colleagues a like.  He has <span class="highlight-green">built up an enviable reputation for himself</span> within a very short space of time.

                      <p>All of Zishu’s feedback alludes to <span class="highlight-green">his willingness to support his team mates</span>, his <span class="highlight-green">eagerness to develop his skills and an outstanding work ethic</span>.

                      <p>He takes a serious approach to his <span class="highlight-green">own personal development</span> and has crafted a number of challenging goals for himself in order to do this.  I would encourage him to keep this focus up throughout his placement and track his progress accordingly … this will provide him with a valuable body of evidence at the end of this year.

                      <p>It’s great to see that Zishu has also found time to <span class="highlight-green">get involved in groups and activities outside of his core role … </span>I suspect this will <span class="highlight">become ever more challenging </span>as his responsibilities grow!

                      <p>I am delighted to confirm that Zishu has passed probation with an “Exceeds” rating across all areas.  Very well done!

                          To take his performance a step further Zishu needs to work with our Dev Lead Luke <span class="highlight">to understand the best practices for his work in-depth</span>, by applying these practices and leading as an example on our project Zishu can continue to make a real difference to what we are doing here." --Harry</p>

                      <p>Hi Zi,
                      <p> Thank you for giving me this opportunity to feedback on your time in Castrol.
                      <p> You have without doubt been a valuable asset to the team. Your tenacity in solving problems, your determination in finding the problem and solving it, your subject matter expertise and desire to improve and above all your positive attitude and personality have been invaluable to the team.
                      <p> The way you have tackled Google analytics for CFL speaks for itself. I have observed how you put forth your ideas and thoughts to the team. You find the right balance between making a point and not being overtly pushy. All of these things will lead you to success.
                      <p> If there is anything I would like you to push harder in, it would be to continue pushing for opportunities that expose you to different business team from different parts of the world. That will truly enable you to become a great leader.
                      <p> All the best Zi, and thank you for all your hard work on CFL.

                    <p><b>3 month with the Project</b></p>
                    <p>In the short time you have been working the project, and I have been your project manager, I have been impressed with <span class="highlight-green">your work ethic and hunger to take on work.</span> Your work ethic is clear and you have quickly made yourself <span class="highlight-green">an invaluable asset to the Castrol Fast Lane team.</span> Within a few weeks you began adding value to the team, by <span class="highlight-green">taking on front end defects</span> on our web application. This has been hugely important as it has taken the workload off colleagues in the team who were overloaded and struggling to keep up with their workload. 
                    <p>I have also been impressed with your <span class="highlight-green">ability to get on with this work, needing little guidance.</span> This is particularly important given the large team size of over 15 and the little time I have to support you. Finally, you have opted to help in another area where the team has little time to focus, Google Analytics, and you demonstrated your consulting skills, discussing one on one with the client how it would work on our project.
                    <p><span class="highlight">In terms of areas of improvement,</span> I would like to see you work on your <span class="highlight">communication and inter-personal skills,</span> some of the key consulting capabilities. An effective consultant understands when to raise concerns, start discussions and when to sit back and listen. This is an area that I believe you can grow and develop to become a great consultant.
                    <p>Overall I have been impressed with your work so far, particularly to add value to a project in a such a short time. 
                    <p>I believe that you have the potential to become a great consultant at IBM, and I would happily recommend you to any project in the future. Your <span class="highlight-green">technical skills are evident</span>, <span class="highlight">keep working on the "soft" skills</span> and I have no doubt you will make it far.
                        
                    <p><b>Project Completion</b></p>
                    <p>I was delighted with your performance on the Castrol Fast Lane project in 2018. I was continuously impressed with <span class="highlight-green">the way you developed your professional skills on the project, and it was a pleasure to witness you grow in front of the client.</span>
                    <p>In particular, the key points I was impressed with where I felt you developed strongly since beginning Castrol were
                    <p>Your client facing skills - you have <span class="highlight-green">shown the ability to consult with the client</span> on Google Analytics, and provide recommendations. This was difficult at times with a demanding client, but you <span class="highlight-green">navigated these conversations well </span>and I was able to <span class="highlight-green">trust you to lead this area of the project</span>, which I feel is <span class="highlight-green">a huge accomplishment for how early you are in your career.</span> I feel you have <span class="highlight-green">grown a huge amount in your professionalism since joining Castrol </span>and this is a foundational skill of any IBM consultant.
                    <p>Your dedicated to learning - you are <span class="highlight-green">not afraid to take on a challenge, and work in your spare time to ensure you have the knowledge the project needs.</span> On multiple occasions you found yourself in a position without the knowledge for the task at hand. Instead of saying you did not know how to do it, you took it upon yourself to learn what was required to help the team where there was a gap. The <span class="highlight-green">positive attitude</span> you show and <span class="highlight-green">the speed at which you picked up new concepts</span> make you truly a team player.
                    <p>Your attitude - you have <span class="highlight-green">become known not only to the project team, but the client as well, as an extremely positive person who brings positivity to the workplace.</span> This is extremely powerful, especially considering you worked mainly with an offshore team. This positivity was a key contributor to the success of Fast Lane, particularly given your direct team member was difficult to work with. You <span class="highlight-green">navigated this difficulty well and continuously showed a brave face. </span>
                    <p>For areas of improvement, I struggle to think of areas given how well you performed on the project. I genuinely feel that you are doing all the things right - if you <span class="highlight">keep up the attitude and dedication to your work, I have no doubt you will do extremely well in your career.</span>
                    <p><span class="highlight-green">In summary, your attitude and passion for your work put you in the top performers of Castrol in 2019.</span> You have built your reputation with the client as someone<span class="highlight"> with a can-do attitude and are admired by all of your peers, onshore and offshore.</span> This is a huge feat given where you are in your career. I am <span class="highlight">hugely thankful for all your help on the Fast Lane project in 2018 - we would not be where we are today without you.</span>
                    <p>I wish you all the best for your next role, and what will be a great career I have no doubt. I look forward to hearing more great feedback for your next role.

                      <p>I think it is fair to say, that at the beginning when you have joined to help us our with the Google Analytics, it took us couple of sessions to align and make sure we are on the same page.

                      <p>You work on front end development, has been really <span class="highlight-green">valuable</span> as well. Whilst all the team in Kolkata were celebrating Diwali, you got stuck in and focused on fixing multiple bugs.
                      <p>Your <span class="highlight-green">dedication to this project was also noticed,</span> as you were staying long hours in the office, and in critical time, when we pushed to launch the product, you came up with the important fixes.

                    <p>
                    <p>Just wanted to write a quick note about Zishu, cc'ed here.
                    <p>I've been <span class="highlight-green">really impressed by his approach</span> the past few weeks. He's <span class="highlight-green">taken the challenges our project are facing in his stride, adapting quickly to changes in requirements and behaving professionally internally on calls and externally with the client.</span> The complexities of our front-end development really push the Power BI tool (and the entire MSFT product workspace) to its limits, and for someone with no prior Power BI experience to achieve so much is incredible. 
                    <p>I've come to him multiple times over the past few weeks, asking him to quickly do some complex work, and then the architecture has changed and we've had to re-do all that. He's approached this incredibly well, <span class="highlight-green">acting quickly and just getting on with it.</span>                     
                    <p>This has all come together in the two handover sessions he led today: Power BI Walkthrough and Power Apps Walkthrough.
                    <p> The preparation put into these were evident and <span class="highlight-green">the way he handled really challenging technical questions</span> from our client was testament to how much he has learnt, and <span class="highlight-green">painted IBM in the best possible light.</span> For a project like ours, sessions like this make such a difference in <span class="highlight-green">showcasing the great work the team has done in the best possible way.</span> 
                    <p> I could go on for ages about the great work he's done, but I'll leave it here. I am aware I have the most visibility of his work and I wanted to take the opportunity to highlight someone who has <span class="highlight-green">made such a positive impact on our project,</span> in both the work he has done and his attitude towards it. 
                    <p> @Zishu - Keep it up, let's smash the last days of this project and deliver a great product to our client.

                    <p> Well done Zishu.
                    <p> This is really great to hear - <span class="highlight-green">your ability to adjust like this in an agile project, to learn so quickly, and add value, is awesome, so well done. </span>
                    <p> -- Fred
                    </p>
                    <p> Amazing to hear, Zishu and couldn't agree more.
                    <span class="highlight-green"><p> Saying that the PowerBI role on Sanctions has been a challenge has been an understatement; with a learning curve so steep it's almost falling back on itself.
                    <p> But you've risen to that challenge admirably and personify what it is to be a Digital@BPer.</p>
                    <p> Best of luck with your grad application and you future career to come! </p>
                    <p> -- Tom 

                    <p>Have to echo what James has said - in the past few weeks Zishu I have been so pleased with your attitude, <span class="highlight-green">the way you've presented yourself and the work you've put in on the alert status change functionality (never been done in BP!!)</span>
                    <p>Well done mate, I heard you ran your handover session brilliantly - thanks for the hard work!

                  <a class="flex-grow-1" style="height:200px; overflow-y: scroll">                        
                    <p>  Hi Zishu! I'm more than happy to provide feedback from the Sanctions Monitoring project. We worked together in the scrum team of this project, your focus being front end development, and myself being the project's designer. You showed <span class="highlight-green">a great proactive attitude before project kick off,</span> learning how to translate your existing front end development skills to PowerBI. This proved to be valuable, as you entered the project with a good understanding of the tool we were using, and the ability to quickly make changes to the front end when requested. 
                    <p>  Alongside your primary task of front end development, you were given a number of technical challenges to research that <span class="highlight-green">pushed the boundaries of what the technology being used was capable of.</span> You produced prototypes, and responded to feedback to find the best solution for these problems. Your <span class="highlight-green">interaction between the team, wider IBM and the client was key to success here.</span> Your problem solving ability greatly improved throughout our time working together, with you <span class="highlight-green">solving complex challenges </span>on the front end which delivered great value to our client.
                    <p>  I was particularly impressed with <span class="highlight-green">how much progression you displayed throughout the project.</span> You took on feedback from the team and applied it to your work, <span class="highlight-green">constantly improving your approach and output throughout the project. </span>By the end of sanctions monitoring, you were working at a level far greater than I would expect from someone at your level of experience - particularly your ability to develop relationships with Rashmi, Abhishek and Rahul, other contractors involved in the project. Sanctions monitoring was a challenging project, and I hope you found it a valuable insight into the role of a consultant in GBS.
                    <p>  In the future, I'd recommend always <span class="highlight">considering the motivations of your stakeholders</span> (be it on the project, the wider IST portfolio, the digital@BP account, or beyond), and "managing upwards". As a skilled resource, you will always be in demand on projects. <span class="highlight">Understanding what your stakeholders are being driven by</span> will enable you to have more informed discussions and will improve your ability to negotiate for the positions you would like to work in. Finally, <span class="highlight">don't be afraid to speak up if you feel you have too much work,</span> some of your best output from the project was a result of less important tasks being delegated away to allow you to focus on the big challenges at hand.
                    <p>  All the best for your time after IBM, and hopefully we will be seeing you back soon.est for your next role, and what will be a great career I have no doubt. I look forward to hearing more great feedback for your next role.
                    </p>
